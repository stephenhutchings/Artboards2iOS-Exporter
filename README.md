Artboards2iOS Exporter
======================

This simple script is perfect if you want to export Illustrator artboards quickly into png's for iOS at standard and retina resolutions ("@2x").

-  It's designed for a super efficient workflow. Just select the output folder.
-  It smartly handles artboard names, ignoring files with a leading hyphen
-  Artboards with an "@2x" modifier will be down-scaled, not upscaled.
-  It allows artboards to have folder paths in their name, so that `path/to/square` will create `square.png` in the `to` subfolder of `path`.
